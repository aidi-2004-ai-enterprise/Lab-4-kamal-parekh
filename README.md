## 1. Choosing Initial Models
- **Benchmark**: Logistic Regression → interpretable, fast, and a baseline for comparison.
- **Advanced Models**: XGBoost + Random Forest → capture non-linear relationships, handle noisy financial data.
- **No Clustering**: Labels available, supervised learning more appropriate.

## 2. Data Pre-processing
- Standardize numeric features → needed for Logistic Regression’s stability.
- Tree-based models unaffected but scaling applied for pipeline consistency.
- No encoding required → dataset features are numeric.
